	The project is sponsored by Dr. Raul Zapata and the UPRM Civil Engineering Department.
	Since the project is an extension of a previous implementation, most of the expenses are already
	covered. Since the aim includes a full deliverable product, new locations cost are included. These
	are installation base, wiring, tablet and a new computer station for the final deliverable in the
	Civil Engineering Building.
