\subsection{Methodology and Metrics}


	The team will be divided into two groups: the hardware team and the software team. The
	hardware team will be responsible for installing the system in the facility, developing the new
	hardware components, and the software team will be primarily responsible for developing the
	software application both in tablet and PC and a server side with a web framework that allows
	future processing of historical data. Both teams will work in the communications module of both
	sides.

	The project at hand is based on the integration of modules which contain the new features.
	(Therefore the metrics used to track progress will be based on the completion of the tasks which
	can also be divided in the same manner - Metrics)

	Hardware team tasks:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Design and implement window motor control hardware.
