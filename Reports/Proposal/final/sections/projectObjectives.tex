\subsection{Project Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
	\item To complete development, integration and installation of the Microprocessor Interfacing course project, AeroBal, in the Civil Engineering Faculty by May 5th, 2014.
	\item Extend this project to achieve the following new objectives.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To implement an application structure to control the system from two different devices: a tablet and a PC.
		\item Create a public repository of data acquired via experiments conducted in the tunnel and provide visualization, statistical and analysis tools of the data.
		\item Implement side component force measurement.
		\item Implement additional pressure sensors for wind speed calculations.
		\item Implement controller circuits to automate the control wind speed window control mechanism.
		\item Implement signal conditioning techniques to obtain reliable measurements from the system.
		\item Implement an additional communication interface between microcontroller and server to persist the data from the experiments. 
		\item Refine and extend the previous microcontrollerâ€™s software for a more reliable and controllable experiment execution.
	\end{itemize}

	%Feature: Make the repository accessible to scientific community via a web dashboard running from data server.
