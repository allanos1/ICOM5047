	\subsection{Market Overview}
	The proposed system is designed to enhance balancing systems used in wind tunnels, and
	thus has a targeted market of organizations or individuals who want to enhance the precision
	or data collection on their wind tunnels. There is currently no general commercial solution for a
	self built wind tunnel like this. Since wind tunnels are built in various ways with different sizes
	and power outputs, the systems used for measurements can be distinct and in turn are developed
	by the makers of the wind tunnel itself. Commercial wind tunnel vendors may include their own
	version for their wind tunnels, which may not be adaptable, or cost efficient for self-made wind
	tunnels. This makes our project useful for any wind tunnel that uses a similar rod balancing
	system for measurements on the object inside, which would enhance precision and the speed of
	data collection.

			\textbf{Risk} & \textbf{Probability} & \textbf{Impact} & \textbf{Actions}\\
		\hline
			Loss of Data & Low & Low & Repository will be backed up externally. Project will continue from last available backup. \\
		\hline
			Damages to Engineer's Workstation & Low & Low & Workstations provided on campus will be used as replacement. Engineer's workstations.\\
		\hline
			Server Functions Suspended or Halted & Low & Medium & Server will be simulated on local workstations if feasible or service will be rented until server is repaired. \\
		\hline
			Natural Disaster & Low & High & If wind tunnel is affected, project will be continued in prototype box until wind tunnel is usable again. \\
		\hline
			Team member Becomes Sick & Low & Medium & If any member is rendered unable to fulfill their duties, their tasks will be delegated accordingly to maintain sprint punctuality.
		\hline
			Team Member Withdraws From Course & Low & High & Team Members have agreed to continue working on th eproject after withdrawal. If member is unwilling or unable, delegation must occur accordingly.
		\hline
			Hardware Components are Late or Faulty & Medium & Medium & Budget allows for overnight shipping of parts in emergency cases.
