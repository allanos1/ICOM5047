\section{Team Organization}
	The teamâ€™s development strategy is the Scrum Framework. This framework
	divides work by sprints (time intervals) with goals to be completed. Sprints will be set at 1 week (EACH???)
	each with a series of meetings specified for each. They are the following:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Sprint Planning: First meeting to plan out objectives for the sprint.
		\item Daily Sprint: Short meeting everyday, to update the entire team.
		\item Sprint Review: Last meeting to inspect, review and update the product increment.
	\end{itemize}
