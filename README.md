Aerobal v2.0

(Fix repo after Git Fail 'cause of Anthony: will not be using Eclipse's Git now. So confusing....)

Juan: Since I'm not skilled with Git, make sure you make backups of every stage of the project just in case. If you're able to recover then do as you please. I had enough trouble with Git from Eclipse and Git from command line. I'm staying with command line. I suggest you do too.
